# Code Summary

## Code Overview

### Overall Purpose
The code defines a data ingestion step that facilitates the loading of data from a specified file into a Pandas DataFrame.

### Problem Solved
It addresses the challenge of abstracting the data ingestion process based on file type, allowing for easy integration of different data sources and formats.

### Functionality Provided
The code provides functionality to:
- Ingest data from a file using a specified data ingestion method based on the file's extension.

## Key Components

### Main Functions

#### `data_ingestion_step`
- **Purpose**: A ZenML step that serves as the entry point for ingesting data from a file.
- **Key Parameters**:
  - `file_path (str)`: The path to the file to be ingested.
- **Functionality**:
  - Determines the file extension using a constant (`EXTENSION_ZIP`).
  - Utilizes the `DataIngestorFactory` to get the appropriate data ingestor based on the file extension.
  - Ingests the data from the specified file and returns it as a Pandas DataFrame.

## Design Patterns

### Patterns Used
- **Factory Pattern**: The `DataIngestorFactory` class implements the factory pattern, providing a way to create data ingestor objects based on file type without exposing the instantiation logic.

### Contribution to Architecture
This pattern enhances flexibility and scalability, allowing new data ingestion methods to be added easily without modifying the existing code structure.

## Logical Aspects

### Important Design Principles

#### Modularity
The code is modular, separating the data ingestion logic from the business logic. This makes the code easier to maintain and test.

#### Extensibility
New data ingestion methods can be integrated by adding new ingestors to the factory, supporting additional file types without changing the core step.

#### Error Handling
The current implementation does not explicitly handle errors that may arise during file ingestion (e.g., file not found, unsupported format). Future improvements could incorporate error handling to ensure robustness.

#### Encapsulation
Responsibilities are well-defined:
- `data_ingestion_step` handles the orchestration of the ingestion process.
- `DataIngestorFactory` manages the creation of specific ingestor instances.

## Usage Example

Hereâ€™s how to use the `data_ingestion_step` function:

```python
# Assuming a valid file path to a ZIP file
file_path = "data/sample_data.zip"
data_frame = data_ingestion_step(file_path)

# Now `data_frame` contains the ingested data
print(data_frame.head())
