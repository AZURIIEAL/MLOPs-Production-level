# Code Summary

## Code Overview

### Overall Purpose
The code implements a framework for performing multivariate analysis on data using correlation heatmaps and pair plots. 

### Problem Solved
It addresses the need for visual representation of relationships between multiple variables in a dataset, allowing data scientists and analysts to quickly identify correlations and distributions.

### Functionality Provided
The code provides functionalities to generate:
- A correlation heatmap to visualize relationships between features in a DataFrame.
- A pair plot to observe pairwise relationships and distributions of selected features.

## Key Components

### Main Classes

#### `MultivariateAnalysisTemplate`
- **Purpose**: An abstract base class that defines the template for multivariate analysis.
- **Key Methods**:
  - `analyze(self, df: pd.DataFrame)`: Orchestrates the analysis process by calling the methods to generate a correlation heatmap and a pair plot.
  - `generate_correlation_heatmap(self, df: pd.DataFrame)`: Abstract method to generate a correlation heatmap.
  - `generate_pairplot(self, df: pd.DataFrame)`: Abstract method to generate a pair plot.

#### `SimpleMultivariateAnalysis`
- **Purpose**: A concrete implementation of `MultivariateAnalysisTemplate` that provides specific functionality for generating visualizations.
- **Key Methods**:
  - `generate_correlation_heatmap(self, df: pd.DataFrame)`: Implements the method to create a correlation heatmap using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
  - `generate_pairplot(self, df: pd.DataFrame)`: Implements the method to create a pair plot using Seaborn.

## Design Patterns

### Patterns Used
- **Template Method Pattern**: The `MultivariateAnalysisTemplate` class defines the overall structure of the multivariate analysis process while allowing subclasses (like `SimpleMultivariateAnalysis`) to implement specific steps.

### Contribution to Architecture
This pattern promotes code reusability and separation of concerns, making it easy to extend the functionality without altering the core logic.

## Logical Aspects

### Important Design Principles

#### Modularity
The code is structured into distinct classes, each with specific responsibilities. This modularity makes the code easier to maintain and understand.

#### Extensibility
New analysis methods can be easily added by creating new subclasses of `MultivariateAnalysisTemplate` that implement the abstract methods.

#### Error Handling
The current implementation lacks explicit error handling. It assumes that the input DataFrame is valid. Future improvements could include checks for DataFrame structure and data types.

#### Encapsulation
Responsibilities are well-defined:
- `MultivariateAnalysisTemplate` handles the analysis process.
- `SimpleMultivariateAnalysis` manages the specific visualization methods.

## Usage Example

Hereâ€™s how to use the `SimpleMultivariateAnalysis` class:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample DataFrame creation
data = {
    'Feature1': [1, 2, 3, 4],
    'Feature2': [4, 3, 2, 1],
    'Feature3': [2, 3, 4, 5]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Performing analysis
analysis = SimpleMultivariateAnalysis()
analysis.analyze(df)
